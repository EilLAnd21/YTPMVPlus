# YTPMVPlus
This is an open source YTPMV+ of the software that powered ToolpostBot since February 2021, up until some time in early 2022. It used to run off a mess of Batch scripts, PHP, webservers, and ytpmv+. I won't put anyone through that, so here's a completely ytpmv+ rewrite based off the Hacked By YTPMV+ source.

**Designed for Windows.**

### Dependencies
- Knowledge on how to setup Node.js and all the other shit needed to make this work.
- ffmpeg and ffprobe in your %PATH% or in the directory of `vegasplusmagicytpmv.exe`. You can get these executables from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html.

### How to Use
- You need Node.js from YTPMV+.
- In the same directory as `YTPMVegasAdaptor.exe`, you need a source MP4 as the video for your generation. Call this `source.mp4`. For best results, don't make it too long.
- Then again in the same directory as `YTPMVegasAdaptor.exe`, you need a `sourcemp3` directory, with ideally as many MP3 files as possible, for maximum randomness. The script will ignore MP3s shorter than the video source.
- Run the batch file `YTPMVegasAdaptor.exe` (or run command `YTPMVegasAdaptor.exe`) to see it work.

* YTPMV+ is a brand new rebuilt system of YTPMV based on the
GTPitch revision 1.0, coded from the ground up. It allows for enhanced
processing, improved pitch, accessible visual presets, easy masking,
a better cookie cutter system and more! It can also run on Mac.
It encompasses everything progressive. You can basically call it
a brand new genre of YTPMV
Will I need to do anything to upgrade?
YTPMV+ is still in its development stages, but we have a stable build
ready for preview release. You are able to use Sony Vegas along with
this build using the included YTPMVegasAdaptor.exe in the release.
